### Root App Structure

```sh
src                   # main application source code
|
+-- app               # application layer containing:
|   |                 # this folder might differ based on the meta framework used
|   +-- routes        # application routes / can also be pages
|   +-- app.tsx       # main application component
|   +-- provider.tsx  # application provider that wraps the entire application with different global providers - this might also differ based on meta framework used
|   +-- router.tsx    # application router configuration
+-- assets            # assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.
|
+-- components        # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- config            # global configurations, exported env variables etc.
|
+-- features          # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # reusable libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- stores            # global state stores
|
+-- testing           # test utilities and mocks
|
+-- types             # shared types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```

### As we are building an application, the structure will be feature based
```sh
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types used within the feature
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature
```

We don't need all the folders, we will create only when we need it

### GIT Branching
```sh
    1. main     # this will contain the stable version of the code (deployable)
    2. develop  # this will contain the ongoing development changes
```
